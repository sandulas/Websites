	<p>"While competing on Dancing With The Stars, I injured my back during the fourth week of the show. I was in so much pain, we feared I
	had broken a rib. Thankfully, my dance partner sent me to Mario. Under Mario's care, not only was I able to dance that week, but stayed
	in competition until the very end. I know my body wouldn't have made it through 3 months of extensive dance training without Mario."</p>

	<p>"Right from the beginning when I started my career as a pro hockey player, Mario prepared me for every game. Whether was massage,
	stretching or training he helped me go that extra shift on the ice. He is truly a talented and gifted trainer and massage therapist!
	He takes training and therapy to a whole different level. I highly recommend Mario!"</p>

	<p>"It didn't matter whether it was injury rehabilitation, off season workout, or mid-season maintenance, I knew I was in competent
	hands! Mario has great workout programs that are creative, challenging and effective, and that makes La Training Room the best training
	room.<br />
	It was a privilege and an advantage to have Mario as a trainer and massage therapist!"</p>
