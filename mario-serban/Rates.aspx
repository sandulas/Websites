	<p class="Bigger">"Right from the beginning when I started my career as a pro hockey player, Mario prepared me for every game. Whether was massage,
	stretching or training he helped me go that extra shift on the ice. He is truly a talented and gifted trainer and massage therapist!
	He takes training and therapy to a whole different level. I highly recommend Mario!"</p>
